jwm_kicad_3dmodels_misc.3dshapes
================================

This is a collection of miscellaneous 3D models for KiCad. Currently, this is my only custom 3D models library, but it's also a holding library before I can break 3D models out into separate specialized libraries.

(You might also be interested in my related [misc symbols library](https://github.com/joem/jwm_kicad_symbols_misc) and [misc footprints library](https://github.com/joem/jwm_kicad_footprints_misc.pretty) for KiCad.)

3D models included in this library:

3D Model | Description
-------- | -----------
QingPu_WQP-PJ302M.wrl | a QingPu WQP-PJ302M horizontal mono switched 3.5mm jack 
RCA-Phono_CUI-Devices_RCJ-02X_Vertical.wrl | a CUI Devices RCJ-02 series vertical RCA phono connector

For an easy preview of what they look like, look in the images folder.

Please feel free to use them as you'd like in your own projects. If they help you, I'm glad.
