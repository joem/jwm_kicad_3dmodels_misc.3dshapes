jwm_kicad_3dmodels_misc.3dshapes
================================

This is a collection of miscellaneous 3D models for KiCad. Currently, this is my only custom 3D models library, but it's also a holding library before I can break 3D models out into separate specialized libraries.

3D models included in this library:

3D Model | Description
-------- | -----------
RCA-Phono_CUI-Devices_RCJ-02X_Vertical.wrl | a CUI Devices RCJ-02 series vertical RCA phono connector

Please feel free to use them as you'd like in your own projects. If they help you, I'm glad.
